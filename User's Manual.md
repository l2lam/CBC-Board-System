## A note about drag-and-drop functionality

Lists (players, games, etc.) can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping items in the list using the mouse or touch gestures.

A game can be dragged from the on-deck queue to a court using the mouse. Using touch, you must tap the game then tap the court (why can't you drag with touch? We haven't figured out to get it to work yet). A game can also be moved from one court to another court using the same techniques.
